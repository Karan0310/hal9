### Databricks + Hal9
You can use Hal9 with Databricks running in databricks.com, Azure, AWS or any other cloud provider that supports Databricks. In addition, you will need Databricks with support for Data Analytics, which is part of Databricks Premium pricing. In addition, the current version of Hal9 requires you to use a Unity Catalog, future versions of Hal9 might drop this requirement.

From Hal9 running in the cloud or on-premise, you will need to configure an ODBC connection string, our team is here to help if you need assistance.
