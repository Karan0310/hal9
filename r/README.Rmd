The goal of hal9 is to provide R users a high-level hal9.js API.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hal9 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hal9ai/hal9ai", subdir = "r")
```

## Basic Usage

Hal9 is a javascript library that enables anyone to compose visualizations and predictive models optimized for websites and web APIs.

You can initialize `hal9` with an empty web app as follows:

```{r example}
library(hal9)

# create app
h9_create()
```

You may also add data as follows:

```{r data}
# load mtcars
h9_create() |>
  h9_load(mtcars)
```

You may also build a specific pipeline using our high-level chart functions:

```{r}
# plot mtcars
h9_create() |>
  h9_load(mtcars) |> 
  h9_scatter_chart(x = "mpg", y = "wt")
```
