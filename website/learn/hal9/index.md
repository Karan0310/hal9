# Hal9: Create and Share AI Coworkers

Hal9 is a platform to effortlessly create and share AI coworkers. As opposed to chatbots, AI coworkers are productivity-focused chatbots that go beyond generic information available in services like ChatGPT, Gemini, Anthropic and the like.

An AI coworker is able to connect to private enterprise datasets, integrate to enterprise communication services, build enterprise applications, and is extensible by developers with powerful open-source libraries. Therefore, AI coworkers must run securely in your own cloud to prevent sharing any private resources with anyone, including Hal9.

Hal9's user interface is a web application that showcases the main use cases on its sidebar to explore existing coworkers, create new coworkers, share coworkers and integrate them with communication tools like Slack.
