# Overview

GenAI stands for **Generative** Artificial Intelligence (**AI**), a version of AI that is good at generating content: text, images, sounds, videos, code, etc.

The previous version of GenAI was reffered to as AI and was based on Deep Neural Networks (**DNN**), brain-inspired math equations optimized for content classificaiton. For example, it enabled computers to identify if pixels in an image represent a cat, or understand if text is written in Spanish.

GenAI uses AI in the opposite way -- not to classify, but to generate content on its own. For example, generate pixels for a cat image, or generate text in Spanish.

Take a look at [Intro to AI](learn-genai/intro-ai) section to learn more about historic aspects of DNN, or jump straight to [Intro to GenAI](learn-genai/intro-genai) to start learning about content generation.
