# Intro

**What is Hal9?** Hal9 is a Python library to help you write your own versions of ChatGPT -- We reffer to those applications as Generative Apps since they use GenAI.

### GenAI

GenAI stands for **Generative** Artificial Intelligence (**AI**), a version of AI that is good at generating content: text, images, sounds, videos, code, etc.

The previous version of GenAI was reffered to as AI and was based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN), brain-inspired math equations optimized for classificaiton for content. For example, it enabled computers to identify if pixels in an image represent a cat, or understand if text is written in spanish.

GenAI uses AI in the opposite way -- not to classify, but to generate the content it classifies. For example, create pixels in an image that shows a cat, or create text in spanish.

### GenApp

Generative Applications are applications (**apps**) written with code that make use of GenAI.

ChatGPT popularized using chatbots as the main interface for these GenApps, other services like Midjourney also used chat interfaces like Disscord, but we are starting to see other interfaces like ChatGPT 4o that run natevely in your mobile phone and can understand voice and video directly. In the not so distant future we might see GenApps that run in Zoom or even robots like Optimus.

New developer jobs will likely require writing code for such new applications to help GenAI learn faster, modify their default behavior, or help them solve harder problems.

For example, even if an AI or a robot was capbale of flying a plane autonomously, developers might want to write code that double checks that the actions are safe, connects to the best weather services, provides flight updates to passengers, etc.

We don't know exactly what the new GenApps will look like and how our jobs or world will transform, but we are certainly optimistic that GenApps will help us solve the harder problems the world is facing around health, education, climate, energy, space exploration, entertaiment, etc.
